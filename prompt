I have the poet agent. I want you to navigate in the poet library, understand the architecture, see what is it made of and summarize how this might be working. Note that this is still under implementation some many files are empty. The goal is to allow you to understand what is going on before I ask you the next question. It is for you to initiate proper context for this conversation
