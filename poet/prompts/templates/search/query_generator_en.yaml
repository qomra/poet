  3. Include both Arabic and English terms when relevant
  4. Optimize for search engine effectiveness
  5. Provide reasoning for each query

  **Response Format:**
  Answer in the following JSON format:
  ```json
  {{
    "primary_queries": [
      {{
        "query": "primary_search_query",
        "language": "arabic/english/bilingual",
        "reasoning": "explanation_of_why_this_query_is_effective",
        "expected_results": "description_of_expected_search_results"
      }}
    ],
    "alternative_queries": [
      {{
        "query": "alternative_search_query",
        "language": "arabic/english/bilingual",
        "reasoning": "explanation_of_why_this_query_is_effective",
        "expected_results": "description_of_expected_search_results"
